**Computer Engineering**:
Passionate about algorithms, robotics, and applied artificial intelligence. I have achieved excellent results in programming exams, demonstrating a strong aptitude for software development.
I am actively working to improve my performance in more complex theoretical subjects, while simultaneously deepening practical projects, including mobile development and the use of Python in AI and robotics.
I'm currently enrolled in a bachelor's program for computer engineering at Politecnico di Torino.
I work part-time programming the Polito Students App. I'm looking to get started on robotics and AI.
